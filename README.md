# hello-world
just following the tutorial at https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/

In Step 3 of the tutorial, I am advised to edit the README.md file in the branch readme-edits, 
to write a bit about myself (!), and to commit these changes. I expect to merge this branch
into the primary branch "master" afterwards (as I can see, in Step 6).
